### Repo Link
 https://github.com/Sparragus/platzi-badges

You may find components and pages. 
- Components are located in `src/components`.
- Pages are located in `src/Pages`.

> Everything has its own CSS file within its folders.

### Issues and More ðŸ¦¯ðŸ™Š
As long of this project I've had some issues and right here, I'll put the fixes.
 * **The styles its doesn't here.**
When I committed the Repo, It hadn't CSS files. In the Course the Instructor brougths some files.
I found how to bring those files from GitHub.
